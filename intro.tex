\chapter*{Introduction}
The idea is to have a \LaTeX-documentation for the whole departement of physics at the ETH Zürich. If this works well, maybe D-MATH or D-CHAB will follow etc. As a student I don't know how this is handled within the groups but all scripts given to me to study with have not been written with the best and/or the most modern \LaTeX-style. Also there are professors that don't do at all their scripts with \LaTeX. So I'd like this to change.

\LaTeX ~is really nice but whenever one wants something or to improve something, one has to google a long time through stuff that doesn't work or isn't compatible with each other. So far, I haven't found any satisfying documentation for \LaTeX ~for physicists so I will start from zero. This document should contain as few as possible solutions but always the best known one compatible with standard packages as AMSmath, etc. Whenever a package is added, it should be documented why.

This should be built up in chapters that everybody uses like maths (integrals etc.) and chapters specific to research groups.
%So far invited a bunch of students and PHD students from different institutes. Everybody that is or has been in the D-PHYS at the ETH Zürich is welcome to contribute to this project. (Of course, if this becomes an interdisciplinary project, this would be even better but for the beginning let's try something ``small''.)
